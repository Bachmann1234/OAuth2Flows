Two samples here - 

* App Engine Python sample that shows Server Side flow.
* Entirely client side flow with "Sign in with Google+. 


These are samples expected to run seperately. For the Server Side flow, I use raw HTTP requests for illustration purposes only. Please use libraries and proper verification process outlined here - https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login#validatinganidtoken
